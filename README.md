**Project Title:** AI-Driven Knowledge Extraction for Property Management

---

## **1. Overview**
We are developing an **automated knowledge extraction pipeline** to analyze historical and ongoing property management conversations. The system will process messages exchanged between residents, AI agents, and human agents, extract structured insights, and store them in a **dynamic knowledge base**. This will enhance AI-driven decision-making in property maintenance tasks.

---

## **2. Objectives**
- Automate the extraction of structured insights from chat conversations.
- Continuously update and evolve the knowledge base with new and refined information.
- Improve AI agent performance in work order intake, triage, vendor coordination, troubleshooting, and emergency classification.
- Provide an accessible, structured database to support AI-driven automation and retrieval.

---

## **3. Scope**
### **Data Sources**
- **tChatMessages** table: Contains conversation history, including AI messages and expert feedback.
- **AIData** field: JSON structure containing expert feedback on AI-generated messages.
- **Work Order Information**: Extracted insights will be linked to work orders for context.

### **Entities to Extract**
- **Issue Type** (classification of the maintenance problem)
- **Scoping Information** (clarifications gathered during interactions)
- **Scoping Instructions** (guidelines on how to scope similar issues)
- **Troubleshooting Steps** (common solutions attempted before escalation)
- **Emergency Indicators** (criteria determining urgency)
- **Conversation Tone** (agent and resident sentiment/tone)

### **Outputs**
- A structured **PostgreSQL database** storing extracted insights.
- Optional **vector-based retrieval** for AI search enhancement.
- Scalable pipeline for periodic updates.

## **4. Technical Design**
### **Pipeline Overview**
1. **Extract**: Query `tChatMessages` for new or updated conversations.
2. **Transform**: Process messages, extract insights using an LLM, validate output.
3. **Load**: Store extracted insights into a structured PostgreSQL knowledge base.
4. **Automate**: Schedule periodic runs using Kubernetes CronJobs.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with optional vector extension for RAG retrieval)
- **Processing**: Python-based ETL pipeline
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, or other available models
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes CronJobs for scheduling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Centralized logging for job tracking

---

## **5. Implementation Plan**
### **Phase 1: Requirements & Scoping**
- Define knowledge fields and extraction logic
- Assess data privacy and compliance considerations

### **Phase 2: Data Modeling & Database Setup**
- Design PostgreSQL schema for extracted knowledge
- Implement database creation and migrations

### **Phase 3: ETL Pipeline Development**
- Implement extraction logic from `tChatMessages`
- Develop LLM-based insight extraction module
- Implement data validation and error handling

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Automation**
- Containerize the ETL pipeline
- Set up Kubernetes CronJobs for scheduled execution
- Implement logging and monitoring

### **Phase 5: Testing & Validation**
- Unit test database updates and ETL components
- Validate extracted knowledge quality against historical cases

### **Phase 6: Optimization & Expansion**
- Aggregate insights at issue-type level
- Introduce vector search for enhanced retrieval
- Optimize LLM prompts and feedback integration

---

## **6. Success Criteria**
- ETL pipeline reliably extracts and stores structured insights.
- AI agents improve response accuracy and efficiency.
- Knowledge base continuously evolves with new data.
- System operates with minimal human intervention while maintaining high accuracy.
- Metrics show reduced resolution time and improved agent effectiveness.

## **7. Risks & Mitigation**
| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| LLM extraction errors | Implement validation and retry logic |
| Schema evolution needs | Use versioned updates and migration tools |
| High API costs for LLM | Optimize prompt efficiency, consider local models |
| Data privacy concerns | Anonymize sensitive data where needed |

---

## **8. Next Steps**
1. Finalize data model and confirm schema requirements.
2. Develop and test ETL extraction logic.
3. Deploy initial pipeline for testing and validation.
4. Iterate based on feedback and performance metrics.
